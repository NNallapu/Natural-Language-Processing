INTRODUCTION 

The idea was to combine a broke college girl’s problems and a pre-teen kid’s problems and see how the combo would look like. 
Initially, I thought of combining Lord Voldemort and Wimpy Kid, but after a few hundred pages I realized that the conveniently
morbid diary entries of Voldemort are very few and it would be difficult to bring more out of the Dark Lord without resorting 
to fan fiction. So, I chose Broke Diaries as my other choice to make ‘Broke Diaries - Wimpy Kid.’

I made a twitterbot that would spit out this combo.
